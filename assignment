**challenges faced**
1. windows
Upgrading vs. Clean Install: Deciding between upgrading from an existing Windows version (simpler) or performing a clean install (potentially wipes data) can be confusing.
2. Visual Studio:

Large Download: Downloading and installing Visual Studio can be time-consuming, especially on slower internet connections.
3. Git and GitHub Account:

Command Line Fear: Git primarily uses the command line, which can be intimidating for beginners. Exploring graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like GitKraken or GitHub Desktop can ease the transition.
Version Control Concepts: Understanding version control concepts like commits, branches, and merging can be challenging at first.
4. Python and pip:

32-bit vs. 64-bit Confusion: Matching the correct Python installer (32-bit or 64-bit) to the student's system architecture can be confusing
one might not realize pip needs separate installation.
